## Bugs and suggestions
This app is in development so you may find bugs, if you have any please create an issue with logcat and I'll try to fix it as fast as I can. Don't report bugs that are already reported or listed in release's description
If you have any suggestions open an issue and explain it

## Compatible devices
Any amazfit device running android (Pace, stratos 1/2/3, verge)

## Notes
- Stratos 3 changed a lot of things so there might be lags which I can't fix, blame huami
- TCX files are saved in "Internal Storage/AmazTimer", for some reason windows sometimes can't read it, so you can get them using `adb pull /sdcard/AmazTimer` or through AmazMod
- If you liked my work, consider buying me a coffee [here](https://www.paypal.me/migueelcs)
